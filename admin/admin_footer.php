==================================================================
FILE: admin/admin_footer.php
PURPOSE: This is the reusable footer for the admin panel.
HOW IT WORKS:
1. It is included at the *very end* of every admin content page.
2. Its only job is to close the HTML tags that were
   opened in 'admin_header.php'.
3. This keeps our content files (like dashboard.php)
   very clean and free of repeated HTML.
